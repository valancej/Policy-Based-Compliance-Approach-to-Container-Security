# Policy Based Compliance Approach to Container Security

## Introduction

At Anchore, we take a preventative, policy based compliance approach specific to organizational needs. Our philosophy of scanning and evaluating Docker images against user defined policies as early as possible in the development lifecycle, greatly reduces vulnerable, non-compliant images from making their way into trusted container registries and production environments.
